If you still don't know what 996 is, please see here: [996.ICU](https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU)

In the face of reality, we can't change anything. The rebellion that most people can do is just give `996.ICU` a `Star` and continue unhealthy work and life.

So. Unhealthy is work, or are we ourselves?

Someone thought about it. What was the last time I was working out? What was the last time I was running? What time was the last meditation?

Some people may say that because of the 996 work system, I don't have time to exercise, I don't have time to run, and I don't have time to meditate.

But it doesn't cost you too much time, it only takes you 2 hours a week.

So, act. Although we are unable to change the status quo, we can change ourselves.

**Work by 996, don't go to ICU.**
