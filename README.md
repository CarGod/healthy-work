If you still don't know what 996 is, please see here: [996.ICU](https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU)

In the face of reality, we can't change anything. The rebellion that most people can do is just give `996.ICU` a `Star` and continue unhealthy work and life.

So. Unhealthy is work, or are we ourselves?

Someone thought about it. What was the last time I was working out? What was the last time I was running? What time was the last meditation?

Some people may say that because of the 996 work system, I don't have time to exercise, I don't have time to run, and I don't have time to meditate.

But it doesn't cost you too much time, it only takes you 2 hours a week.

So, act. Although we are unable to change the status quo, we can change ourselves.

**Work by 996, don't go to ICU.**

## How to work healthily

In China **2,300** years ago, there was a book called **"Huang Di Nei Jing"**, which laid the foundation of the theory of Chinese medicine, which contained the secrets of Chinese medicine and longevity, and was a treasure of the Chinese nation.

**Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth**

With the development of science and technology, more and more evidence shows that Chinese medicine is effective. The footprint of Chinese medicine is spread all over the world. In some cities in the United States, Chinese medicine has become the first choice for people to see a doctor. The figure of Chinese medicine also appears in the Olympic Games and is responsible for the health of athletes.

## The Secret of Huang Di Nei Jing

In the Yellow Emperor's Canon, this describes a healthy lifestyle:

```text
黄帝问曰：

余闻上古之人，春秋皆度百岁，而动作不衰；今时之人，年半百而动作皆衰者，
时世异耶，人将失之耶。

岐伯对曰：

上古之人，其知道者，法于阴阳，和于术数，食饮有节，起居有常，不妄作劳，
故能形与神俱，而尽终其天年，度百岁乃去。

今时之人不然也，以酒为浆，以妄为常，醉以入房，以欲竭其精，以耗散其真，
不知持满，不时御神，务快其心，逆于生乐，起居无节，故半百而衰也。
```

Huang Di asked Qi Bo:

I heard that people in ancient times can live more than a hundred years old, and their physical state is no different from when they were young. Nowadays, people are very sick at the age of 50, osteoporosis, lumbar disc herniation. Is it caused by environmental reasons, or is there something that people in the present have not done?

Qibo replied:

People in ancient times, some of whom know how to maintain health, they get up at six o'clock during the day, rest before ten o'clock in the evening, know how to nurse their body. The diet is modest and the living is regular. Do not pursue vain things, do not work to the point of being very tired. Therefore, they can combine the spirit and the body very well, so after a healthy life, they will die in their 100s.

Nowadays people don't know the importance of health care, drink wine as water, blindly pursue some illusory things, make love after drunk, use their desire to exhaust their own vital spirit of a man, do not know how to nurse their spirit, in pursuit of happiness Regardless of physical health, there is no regular living, and the diet is not controlled, so the body is aging at the age of 50.
